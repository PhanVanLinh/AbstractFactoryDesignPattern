# AbstractFactoryDesignPattern


### Factory:
Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
### FactoryMethod
Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses
### Abstract FactoryMethod


### My current understand

Look like `Factory method` is a part of `Factory` and `Abstract FactoryMethod` is a factory of factories
